## What I learned: 
I learned about the workings of R and how to apply them. For the first day, I learned about the format of R, how to connect 2 graphs or concatenations through the 
use of data.frame and bind. I need to make sure that when binding by the column, to write the bigger concatenation first to prevent any missing data, or cutting it out. I learned 
about the types of classes used in R and how they can sometimes converted into other classes and sometimes not. For the second day, I learned about the random uniform 
varible and the normal random varible. One has numbers evenly spread out through a range while the other has a more bell shaped curve. The random uniform
varible can be used to calculate pi by randomly picking points in a board and have the red to black dots be the same ratio as pi/4. The normal random varible can be used
to calculate the cumulative return of a stock price.
