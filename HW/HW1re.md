## What I Learned
I learned about the workings of R and how to apply them. For the first day, I learned about the format of R, how to connect 2 graphs or concatenations through 
the use of data.frame and bind. I need to make sure that when binding by the column, to write the bigger concatenation first to prevent any missing data, or 
cutting it out. I learned about the types of classes used in R and how they can sometimes converted into other classes and sometimes not.We also talked about 
how AI is used in the first day by analizing an iron man fight scene. The AI most likely tracks the entire body and compares it to the training data to make a prediction on how it works. 
For the second day, I learned about the random uniform varible and the normal random varible. One has numbers evenly spread out through a range while the other has a more bell shaped 
curve. The random uniform varible can be used to calculate pi by randomly picking points in a board and have the red to black dots be the same ratio as pi/4. 
The normal random varible can be used to calculate the cumulative return of a stock price.
